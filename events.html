                <h3>NeurIPS meetup, Dec 16th, 2019 </h3>
                <p>
                  Did you want to go to NeurIPS but couldn't make it this year? No problem, we're here to help... Toulouse Data Science and TIdDLe are co-organizing a one-day <b>NeurIPS meetup</b> (officially approved by the NeurIPS organizers). The event will take place on <i>December 16th, in the Auditorium of the Village By Ca </i> (31 all√©es Jules Guesdes, close to Palais de Justice). 
                </p>
                <p>
                  *Registration is free and open to anyone*, but the number of participants is limited, and we need a headcount before December 10th, so please register as soon as possible (before December 10th) by sending an email to <i>andrea.alamia@cnrs.fr</i> with names, affiliations and emails of those attending (if you are coming with your team/colleagues, you can group several persons in one email).
                </p>
                <p>
                  
                  Besides, don't forget that you have still time to submit a title and abstract (300 words max) to present your work at the meetup (deadline on Friday the 6th)!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here is a preliminary <b> program </b> of the event (based on the number of abstract submissions, we may modify the number/duration of oral presentations):

                <h3>First TIdDLe Seminar (Dec 2nd, 2019)</h3>
                <p>
                    The first seminar will take place the 2nd of December from 14:30 to 15:30 at the IRIT Auditorium in the Paul Sabatier Campus. We will have two speakers, and each presentation will last 20 minutes plus an additional 10 minutes for questions. Everybody is welcome to join!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The speakers are Bhavin Choksi from CerCo who will present his current work on biologically inspired neural networks, and Vincent Roger from IRIT who will provide an overview about few-shot learning techniques.

                <h3>First DeepBeer (Nov 18th, 2019)</h3>
                <p>
                    It was the right time to turn on our TIdDLe community! A good starter to get to know each other with a very informal event: our first DeepBeer meeting at Le Pery (https://www.lepery.com/).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of the Deep Beer Meeting is to have a monthly event which gathers Tiddle members in front of a (few) beer(s). It's informal, fun and with variable location! The goal is to get to know each other without necessarily talking about Deep things. Everyone is welcome to join, so feel free to spread the invitation to friends and colleagues!

              <h3>Inaugural meeting (Feb 7th, 2019)</h3>
              <p>
                Our inaugural meeting took place at the B612 "Aerospace Valley" building on February 7th, 2019.
              <img src="img/TIdDLe_meeting1.jpg" alt="tiddle meeting schedule" style="float:left;width:350px;padding-top:12px;padding-right:20px"> 	
              About 80 permanent researchers from academia and industrial partners registered to the event. <br><br>
                We had plenty of general discussions, before, after and during the 16 scientific presentations.
              Group organization issues were discussed, ideas for future events, and modes of operation (including 
              the present website and the list of members expertise with contact info). 
                <br><br>
              The final cocktail was much appreciated, especially the apple cider.
