                <h3>First DeepBeer (Nov 18th, 2019)</h3>
                <p>
                    It was the right time to turn on our TIdDLe community! A good starter to get to know each other with a very informal event: our first DeepBeer meeting at Le Pery (https://www.lepery.com/).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of the Deep Beer Meeting is to have a monthly event which gathers Tiddle members in front of a (few) beer(s). It's informal, fun and with variable location! The goal is to get to know each other without necessarily talking about Deep things. Everyone is welcome to join, so feel free to spread the invitation to friends and colleagues!

              About 80 permanent researchers from academia and industrial partners registered to the event. <br><br>
                We had plenty of general discussions, before, after and during the 16 scientific presentations.
              Group organization issues were discussed, ideas for future events, and modes of operation (including 
              the present website and the list of members expertise with contact info). 
                <br><br>
              The final cocktail was much appreciated, especially the apple cider.
